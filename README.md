# Design

This project focuses on a novel approach to Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solutions,
enabling seamless deployment of unmodified Linux and Windows desktop applications.
Unlike traditional methods, this solution allows users
to interact with applications entirely through a browser,
eliminating the need for additional client software.
The contained source code was created during a research project
and represents a prototypic state of implementation.
It still contains some rough edges,
so be warned and don't use it in productive environments!

## Features

- Enables deployment of unmodified Linux and Windows applications
- Integration of Virtual Machines and Containers (by using Proxmox and Docker)
- Browser-based user interaction (by using Guacamole as a Desktop Gateway)
- Dedicated user frontend [Repo: Frontend](https://github.com/nuromedia/design-daas-application-frontend)
- Dedicated authentication backend [Repo: Backend](https://github.com/nuromedia/design-daas-application-backend)

## Installation

The installation depends on Debian12 and several additional components and libraries.
A Makefile with all installation steps is provided in the "installer" folder.
Use it to install all components seperately.

### Prerequisites

#### Supported Operating Systems (Host)

- Debian12

#### Utilized Libraries and Tools

- Guacamole
- Proxmox
- qemu-kvm
- docker.io
- Python 3.11+

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nuromedia/design-daas.git
```

#### Install Custom Proxmox Kernel

```bash
cd installer
export HOST_NAME=pve HOST_DOMAIN=cluster.local HOST_IP=10.0.2.15 HOST_NUMBER=111
make proxmox-install
shutdown -r now
```

#### Install Proxmox

```bash
cd installer
export HOST_NAME=pve HOST_DOMAIN=cluster.local HOST_IP=10.0.2.15 HOST_NUMBER=111
make proxmox-install
```

#### Install Design Platform

```bash
cd installer
export HOST_NAME=pve HOST_DOMAIN=cluster.local HOST_IP=10.0.2.15 HOST_NUMBER=111
make daas-all STANDALONE=yes
```

#### Install Design Service Containers

```bash
cd installer
export HOST_NAME=pve HOST_DOMAIN=cluster.local HOST_IP=10.0.2.15 HOST_NUMBER=111
make daas-services
```

#### Install Design Templates

```bash
cd installer
export HOST_NAME=pve HOST_DOMAIN=cluster.local HOST_IP=10.0.2.15 HOST_NUMBER=111
make daas-containers # Baseimages Docker
make proxmox-isogen  # Baseimages VM
```

#### Install Frontend

```bash
cd installer
export HOST_NAME=pve HOST_DOMAIN=cluster.local HOST_IP=10.0.2.15 HOST_NUMBER=111
make frontend-all
```

## Usage

The installer creates systemd targets for daas nginx and the frontend.
Use systemctl or comparable alternatives to control them.
By default, nginx is used as a proxy to host the daas application on the default port 443 and the frontend on 8443.
Both are reachable by using any modern web browser.

- [Video: Usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZoH-ngyu9E)

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl restart daas
systemctl restart frontend
```
